# TOTK Challenge Mode Randomizer

A modified version of [MelonSpeedrun](https://github.com/MelonSpeedruns)'s TOTK Randomizer, modified to be fully compatible with challenge mode. Note: If you want the map to be the version from challenge mode, but randomized, you will have to make a romfs with Challenge mode's Banc files, along with the vanilla ones the randomizer looks for, CM's GameData, RESTBL, the bfevfl's the randomizer needs and Zdic.pack from the base game. This is optional, however.

## Quick start

Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/DisBot404/TotkRandomizer/releases) section and download the latest artifact `CMRandomizer[INSERT_NUMBER_HERE].zip` file. Run it and configure it. Once the randomization process starts, it will create a new `romfs` folder next to the application. Simply install that `romfs` folder just like you would any other mod!

The randomizer works on a real Nintendo Switch console, Ryubing and a certain emulator named after a japanese citrus fruit.

If the app doesn't launch for you when double clicking it, then you might be missing the latest [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.3-windows-x64-installer)
